## 📋 KEY STANDARDS TO FOLLOW

### Every Analysis Script Must Include:

#### 1. **Header Documentation**
```r
# =============================================================================
# [Script Name] - [Brief Description]
# =============================================================================
#
# Purpose: [What this script does]
# Input: [Input files/data]
# Output: [Output files generated]
# Standards: Based on PROJECT_STANDARDS_CHECKLIST.md
# =============================================================================

# Load logging
source("Scripts/log_activity.R")
log_script_start("[script_name]", "[description]")
```

#### 2. **Survival Analysis Standards**
```r
# ALWAYS include both:
# 1. Univariate Cox (screening)
cox_uni <- coxph(Surv(OS_years, OS_status) ~ DGAT1_high_low, data = metadata)

# 2. Multivariable Cox (primary claim) ⭐⭐⭐
cox_multi <- coxph(Surv(OS_years, OS_status) ~ DGAT1_high_low + 
                   age + sex + WHO_grade + IDH_status + MGMT_status + purity,
                   data = metadata)

# Test proportional hazards
test_ph <- cox.zph(cox_multi)
```

#### 3. **Correlation Analysis Standards**
```r
# ALWAYS include:
# - Spearman correlation (non-parametric)
# - FDR correction (Benjamini-Hochberg)
# - Sample size reporting

cor_results <- cor.test(dgat1_expr, immune_score, method = "spearman")
p_adjusted <- p.adjust(p_values, method = "BH")  # FDR correction

# Report: r, p-value, FDR, N
```

#### 4. **Batch Correction Standards**
```r
# ALWAYS validate:
# 1. PC-batch correlation before/after
cor_before <- cor(pca_before$PC1, batch_variable, method = "spearman")
cor_after <- cor(pca_after$PC1, batch_variable, method = "spearman")

# 2. Statistical test
kruskal.test(PC1 ~ batch_variable)

# 3. Document biology preserved
# Check IDH/Grade clustering preserved
```

#### 5. **Immune Analysis Standards**
```r
# ALWAYS include:
# 1. Primary method (GSVA)
gsva_scores <- gsva(expr_matrix, gene_sets, method = "gsva")

# 2. Validation method (CIBERSORTx) ⭐⭐
cibersort_results <- run_cibersortx(expr_matrix, LM22, perm = 1000)

# 3. Confounder assessment
cor.test(DGAT1, tumor_purity)  # Check for confounding

# 4. FDR correction
fdr_corrected <- p.adjust(p_values, method = "BH")
```

## ⭐ WEEK 1 PRIORITIES (MUST DO FIRST)

### Priority 1: Multivariable Cox Models ⭐⭐⭐
**Why:** Required in 70% of papers; reviewers WILL reject univariate-only claims  
**Time:** 1 day  
**Action:** Add clinical covariates to all survival models

### Priority 2: Batch Validation Metrics ⭐⭐
**Why:** Expected in 80-90% of papers; de facto standard  
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Action:** Create formal validation table with PC-batch correlations

### Priority 3: Tumor Purity Assessment ⭐⭐
**Why:** Required in 60-70% of papers; demonstrates no confounding  
**Time:** 2 hours  
**Action:** Test DGAT1 vs purity correlation, include in Cox models

### Priority 4: CIBERSORTx Validation ⭐⭐
**Why:** Validates GSVA; increasingly expected (40-60% of papers)  
**Time:** 1 day  
**Action:** Run deconvolution, cross-validate with GSVA

## 📊 CURRENT STATUS

| Component | Complete | Priority | Next Action |
|-----------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Data preprocessing | ✅ 95% | - | Done |
| Batch correction | ✅ 95% | ⭐ | Add metrics table |
| GSVA signatures | ✅ 100% | - | Done |
| Univariate Cox | ✅ 100% | - | Done |
| **Multivariable Cox** | ❌ 0% | **⭐⭐⭐** | **Week 1 Day 1** |
| **CIBERSORTx** | ❌ 0% | **⭐⭐** | **Week 1 Day 3** |
| **Purity assessment** | ❌ 0% | **⭐⭐** | **Week 1 Day 2** |

**Overall:** 60% publication-ready → Target: 85% after Week 1

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FROM STANDARDS

### What IS Required:
- ✅ Multivariable Cox for survival claims (70% of papers)
- ✅ Batch correction validation (80-90% of papers)
- ✅ Some form of immune deconvolution (universal)
- ✅ FDR correction for multiple testing (universal)
- ✅ Independent validation cohort (50-70% of papers)

### What is NOT Required (but good to have):
- ⏸️ Pre-adjustment of expression for confounders (<10% of papers)
- ⏸️ Multi-algorithm deconvolution (30-40% of papers)
- ⏸️ TPM conversion (FPKM acceptable, 60% use provided format)
- ⏸️ HTML QC reports (<10% of papers)

### Bottom Line:
**Focus on the Week 1 priorities. They will take you from 60% → 85% publication-ready in just 4-5 days of focused work.**

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

### Tomorrow (Monday):
1. Start with Multivariable Cox models (highest priority)
2. Create batch validation metrics table
3. Test DGAT1 vs purity correlations

### This Week:
- Complete all 4 Week 1 priorities
- Update checklist as you go
- Log progress daily

### Next Week:
- CGGA validation
- Patient characteristics table
- Main figures
- Methods writing
