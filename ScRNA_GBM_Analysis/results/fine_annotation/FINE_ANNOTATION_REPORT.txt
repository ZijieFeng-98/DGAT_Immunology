[BIOLOGY] KEY FINDINGS:
  - Total immune cells: 5,385 (46.3%)
    * Myeloid: 1,767 (15.2%)
    * Lymphoid: 3,618 (31.1%)

[REF] LITERATURE COMPARISON:
  - Klemm et al., 2020, Nature: Expected 10-15 populations in GBM
  - Your analysis: 13 populations
  - Assessment: Matches published GBM heterogeneity

[REF] NEURO-ONCOLOGY METHODOLOGY:
  - Study approach: 22 immune cell types identified
  - Collapsed into: Myeloid, Lymphoid, Neutrophil, DC, B/Plasma
  - Our approach: Same strategy with GBM-specific markers

[TIP] RECOMMENDATIONS:
  1. Validate annotations with marker gene expression
  2. Check for expected cell types in tumor vs normal
  3. Examine DGAT1 expression across fine cell types
  4. Compare malignant state proportions
  5. Analyze immune cell infiltration patterns
