DATA PROVENANCE:
  Source: TCGA GDC Data Portal
  Project: TCGA-GBM
  Workflow: STAR - Counts
  Normalization: FPKM (unstrand)
  Gene IDs: Converted to HGNC symbols

PREPROCESSING STEPS:
  1. Downloaded via TCGAbiolinks from GDC
  2. Converted Ensembl IDs to HGNC gene symbols
  3. Filtered to primary solid tumors (code 01)
  4. Deduplicated to one sample per patient
  5. Filtered genes: protein-coding + â‰¥10% detection
  6. Validated with known prognostic markers
