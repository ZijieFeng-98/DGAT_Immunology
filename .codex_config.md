# Codex Agent Configuration for DGAT Immunology Project

## Quick Start

### Launch Codex Agent
```powershell
# From project root
.\Scripts\codex_helper.ps1

# Or directly
codex

# Or from anywhere
D:\codex
```

### Common Codex Commands for This Project

#### Analyze R Scripts
```bash
codex "review Scripts/Transcriptomics/ for best practices"
codex "explain the TCGA_GBM pipeline in Scripts/Transcriptomics/"
codex "optimize Scripts/Proteomics/01_CPTAC_data_processing.R"
```

#### Data Processing Help
```bash
codex "explain Processed_Data/TCGA_GBM_Master_Pipeline/"
codex "help with batch correction in CGGA_GBM data"
codex "review survival analysis workflow"
```

#### Code Generation
```bash
codex "create a new script for lipid marker analysis"
codex "add documentation to project_config.R"
codex "generate QC plots for proteomics data"
```

#### Project Understanding
```bash
codex "explain the overall project structure"
codex "what are the main analysis pipelines?"
codex "summarize the data processing workflow"
```

## Approval Modes

Codex operates with different approval modes:

- **Auto** (Default): Can read/edit files in working directory, asks approval for outside actions
- **Read Only**: Can inspect and explain without making changes
- **Full Access**: Can read/edit/run commands without approval (use with caution)

Switch modes within Codex: `/approvals`

## Project Context

When Codex starts in `/mnt/d/DGAT_Immunology`, it has context of:

- **R Scripts**: Transcriptomics & Proteomics analysis pipelines
- **Data**: TCGA_GBM, CGGA_GBM, CPTAC_GBM datasets
- **Results**: Processed outputs and QC reports
- **Documentation**: Project summaries and workflows

## Integration with Cursor

This project uses both:
- **Cursor AI** - For IDE-based assistance
- **Codex CLI** - For terminal-based agent tasks

Use Codex for:
- Complex multi-step tasks
- Terminal-based workflows
- Batch processing operations
- Deep code reviews

Use Cursor AI for:
- Real-time code editing
- Quick suggestions
- Inline documentation
- File navigation

## Tips

1. **Start specific**: Give Codex clear, specific tasks
2. **Use project paths**: Reference files/directories by their project paths
3. **Review changes**: Always review Codex's changes before applying
4. **Iterative refinement**: Break complex tasks into smaller steps

## Installed Version

Codex CLI: 0.47.0
Location: WSL Ubuntu (via nvm)
